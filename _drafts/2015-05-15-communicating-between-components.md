title: Communicating between Components ( Parent to child ) - ReactJS
published: true

I want to communicate a property change from one component to another component.

The answers on Stackoverflow involved quite a bit of complexity, I have tried to explain it in a simple manner.

In this scenario the outer component can change the properties of the inner component.

The inner component can also change itself, although can't change the properties of the outer component.

**The inner component**

{% highlight javascript %}

InnerComponent = React.createClass({

  getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      changed: this.props.changed
    };
  },
  componentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {
    return this.setState({
      changed: nextProps.changed
    });
  },
  render: function() {
    # view the full render function in codepen
  }

});

{% endhighlight %}

The primary concept is that the state of the outer component is copied into the props of the inner component.

**The outer component**

{% highlight javascript %}

OuterComponent = React.createClass({

  getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      changed: false
    };
  },

  render: function() {

    # view the full render function in codepen

    InnerComponent({changed: this.state.changed})
  }
});


{% endhighlight %}


I didn't include the details of the render functions but you can view and edit all the code in the demo I prepared on codepen.
